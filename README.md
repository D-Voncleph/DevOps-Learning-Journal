# DevOps Learning Journal

This repository serves as my personal journal to track my progress and learning throughout my DevOps journey. It contains weekly summaries, key takeaways, and reflections on the topics and labs I have completed.

## Structure

Each week is documented in a separate Markdown file, providing a chronological record of my skills development.
