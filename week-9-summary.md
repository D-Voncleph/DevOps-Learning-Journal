# Week 9 Summary: Python Fundamentals for Automation

This week, I began a new phase of my learning journey by diving into Python for DevOps. My goal was to learn the foundational skills necessary to write automation scripts, and by the end of the week, I had a working repository of my own.

I started the week by setting up my Python environment and reviewing core concepts like variables, data types, and operators. I then moved on to control flow, learning about if/elif/else statements and the two types of loops: for and while.

The rest of the week was dedicated to practical labs and projects. I applied my new knowledge to solve the classic FizzBuzz challenge, wrote a script to validate user input, and started a new python-for-devops repository. In this final project, I learned about Python lists and modules, which allowed me to generate a list of fake usernames.

Looking back, I can see a clear difference between Python and the Bash scripting I learned last month. While Bash is perfect for command-line file operations, Python is a more structured and powerful language for handling data and complex logic. This week's work has given me a solid foundation for writing more advanced automation scripts in the future.
