## Week 11 Summary: The Power of Functions

This week, my learning journey centered on one of the most powerful concepts in programming: functions. I learned that functions are not just a tool for organizing code, but a fundamental building block for writing clean, reusable, and scalable scripts.

The core purpose of a function is to take a specific action and encapsulate it into a single, named block. This is a crucial practice because it prevents me from having to copy and paste the same code over and over again. Instead, I can simply "call" the function by its name whenever I need that action performed.

This concept was reinforced by learning about requests.get(), which is a function that was written by someone else for me to use. It showed me that by writing my own functions, I am not just improving my own scripts but am also creating code that can be shared and reused by others.

Using functions allowed me to refactor my code and create a module for my MyFinanceTracker app, demonstrating how they are essential for building larger, more complex applications in a clean and organized way.
